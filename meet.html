            Axia Dev is a blockchain developer who ported from backend
            development with PHP. He has been a cryptocurrency enthusiast and an
            investor from early 2016. Since then his passion has always been in
            programmingand that drives his desire to get his code and programs
            working as intended.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-4" style="line-height: 2rem">
            In his early years as a programmer, he has always found himself
            sitting for lengthy hours front of his computer working until a
            program works smoothly and effeciently, the zeal is self induced
            when it comes to programming. This stems from his passion about
            programming and fascination with blockchain technology that explains
            his continous growth in space. He tells us that, "Growing from an
            investor while programming and as a backend developer with PHP until
            I found my feet in solidity programming has really been n
            interesting experience for me which is not going to die off in the
            near future."

                Sam has started to get interested in cryptocurrencies in 2017,
                as the years went on continued to remain interested in the space
                throughout the bear market. During early-2020, he started to
                immerse himself into the world of Decentralised Finance. Quickly
                realising the potential of DeFi had to radically transform the
                financial system to benefit everyone that participates in it,
                not just the rich and powerful. To raise awareness of the
                potential of DeFi for newcomers, Sam has also started a blog
                DeFi Dive:

                In November of 2020, Sam joined the Axia community and as time
                went on wanted to help bring awareness to the potential of Axia,
                especially to newcomers to DeFi and crypto. One of the key
                use-cases of Axia is that it's able to simplify investing into
                crypto for newcomers without requiring in-depth knowledge on
                various projects. By investing into the Axia index pools, one
                can invest simply into various proven projects with a few clicks
                and earn passive income along the way. Sam's goal is to help
                make newcomers to DeFi and crypto aware of this

                Yourfacemyfoot is a lifelong martial artist on the journey of
                becoming a practicing medical doctor. He began martial arts at
                the age of 3, instructing and mentoring students in his teenage
                years, and eventually becoming a world champion competitor.
                Eventually, his skill of overseeing martial arts studios bridged
                into his creation of a digital marketing agency supporting
                businesses and organizations across the USA. This understanding
                of marketing tactics and business fundamentals became even more
                valuable as he became enthralled with trading stocks and
                investing in cryptocurrencies in 2017. In more recent years, and
                to add another spice to his mix, he committed to the arduous,
                yet rewarding journey of helping others in a vastly different
                form from his previous ventures: medicine. Alongside this
                pursuit, he is leading his own research study on the link
                between Alzheimer's Disease and Down Syndrome. You can find
                @yourfacemyfoot surfing the Pacific and DeFi waves, running in
                the southern California mountains, off-roading in the Mojave
                Desert, and caring for patients in local hospitals. One day, you
                will find him both in the operating rooms and the board rooms.
